# House Price Prediction using Ridge Regression

A Machine Learning project that predicts house prices using the Ridge Regression model based on various housing features.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices by applying Ridge Regression, a regularized linear regression technique that helps reduce overfitting by adding an L2 penalty. The model is trained on historical housing data and evaluated for accuracy.
